# <RFC title>

## Summary

> Brief explanation of the feature.

## Basic example

> If the proposal involves a new or changed API, include a basic code example. Omit this section if it's not applicable.

## Motivation

> Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected outcome?
>
> Please focus on explaining the motivation so that if this RFC is not accepted, the motivation could be used to develop
> alternative solutions. In other words, enumerate the constraints you are trying to solve without coupling them too
> closely to the solution you have in mind.

## Requirements

> What specific requirements does your design need to meet? This should ideally be a bulleted list of items you wish
> to achieve with your design. This can help everyone involved (including yourself!) make sure your design is robust
> enough to meet these requirements.
>
> Once everyone has agreed upon the set of requirements for your design, we can use this list to review the detailed
> design.

### Extensibility

> Please also call out extensibility requirements. Is this proposal meant to be extended in the future? Are you adding
> a new API or set of models that others can build on in later? Please list these concerns here as well.

## Non-Requirements

> Call out things you don't want to discuss in detail during this review here, to help focus the conversation. This can
> include things you may build in the future based off this design, but don't wish to discuss in detail, in which case
> it may also be wise to explicitly list that extensibility in your design is a requirement.
>
> This list can be high level and not detailed. It is to help focus the conversation on what you want to focus on.

## Detailed design

> This is the bulk of the RFC.

> Explain the design in enough detail for somebody familiar with the framework to understand, and for somebody familiar
> with the implementation to implement. This should get into specifics and corner-cases, and include examples of how the
> feature is used. Any new terminology should be defined here.

## How we teach this

> What names and terminology work best for these concepts and why? How is this idea best presented? As a continuation
> of existing DataHub patterns, or as a wholly new one?

> What audience or audiences would be impacted by this change? Just DataHub backend developers? Frontend developers?
> Users of the DataHub application itself?

> Would the acceptance of this proposal mean the DataHub guides must be re-organized or altered? Does it change how
> DataHub is taught to new users at any level?

> How should this feature be introduced and taught to existing audiences?

## Drawbacks

> Why should we *not* do this? Please consider the impact on teaching DataHub, on the integration of this feature with
> other existing and planned features, on the impact of the API churn on existing apps, etc.

> There are tradeoffs to choosing any path, please attempt to identify them here.

## Alternatives

> What other designs have been considered? What is the impact of not doing this?

> This section could also include prior art, that is, how other frameworks in the same domain have solved this problem.

## Rollout / Adoption Strategy

> If we implemented this proposal, how will existing users / developers adopt it? Is it a breaking change? Can we write
> automatic refactoring / migration tools? Can we provide a runtime adapter library for the original API it replaces? 

## Future Work

> Describe any future projects, at a very high level, that will build off this proposal. This does not need to be
> exhaustive, nor does it need to be anything you work on. It just helps reviewers see how this can be used in the
> future, so they can help ensure your design is flexible enough.

## Unresolved questions

> Optional, but suggested for first drafts. What parts of the design are still TBD?
